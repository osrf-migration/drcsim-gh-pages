Tested with 1.4 - sorry but I can't work of the 1.5 branch! Please ignore if you think they are irrelevent for 1.5\n\nSome images demoing issues:\nhttp://people.csail.mit.edu/mfallon/vrc_worlds/\n1. yellow/black replacement texture on several objects: start location, signs, cones etc. I think this been fixed in the 1.5 branch though.\n2. lighting of robot is wrong in vrc1 and vrc2\n3. texture on gates is much too small. As you can see in issues1.png the checker pattern cannot be seen.\n\nOthers:\n4. vrc_task_1.world specfied:\n        <model_name>golf_cart</model_name>\nand this is included:\n      <uri>model://polaris_ranger_ev</uri>\n\n5. For me it works at 0.55 (with visual imagery output to ROS at 10Hz)\n6. no laser data published - not sure why. Thomas doesnt seem to have that problem.\n\n7. hose CoM is terrible, as is the bounding box and of course its actually has a fixed link. See image with Bounding box cube.\n\n8. When I press play the rubble falls at a speed much lower than the Real Time fraction I'm seeing reported. Not sure whats going on there.\n\n9. The 90degree turn of the road is very tight given the vehicle. Can the vehicle even do this turn? Can these turns be made to be smoother?\n\n10. When I place the robot in the vehicle (via the placing hack), it cannot be driven - it seems to be locked at the starting x,y,z. But when the robot isnt in the car it can be driven with ros messages. this is not the same as in my own world.\n\nAlso what efforts will be made to randomise the runs? Will lengths, placements and angles be changed? (I noticed the rubble is random)\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Here's some issues from me.
