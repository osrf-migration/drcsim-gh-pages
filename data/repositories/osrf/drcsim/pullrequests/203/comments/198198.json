I made the stride length default a bit more conservative so that when resetting the robot with an internal state that is off, it will be more stable.

I think the controller's internal state believes the robot to be in a different position than it currently is, so it tries to make large corrections. I've gotten around this by taking a couple of single steps with 0 length in place. Then taking a forward trajectory of 3 steps with stride length 0.1m. More often then not, this gets it to a usable situation.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Pushed several changes to the keyboard teleop.
