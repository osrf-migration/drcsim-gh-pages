We don't experience any, despite the low CFM damping.\n\nI didn't understand at first that you're planning to use this parameter as a damping gain that is changed dynamically in your controller. Is this the idea of the pull request? My understanding was that the CFM damping would be a parameter that could be set only once at startup and needs to be configurable because apparently the BDI walking algorithm doesn't walk without it being set to a huge value (i.e. a hack to get things to work).\n\nI get that you want to get better performance out of the local position control loop, but is it fair to teams that don't do position control and have to live with the crappy velocity signals? Changing the CFM damping once at startup could be the equivalent of modifying the physical robot to add more viscous damping to the joints, but it wouldn't be possible to change the mechanical viscous damping on the fly.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>The problem I was referring to is pitch sway while standing.
