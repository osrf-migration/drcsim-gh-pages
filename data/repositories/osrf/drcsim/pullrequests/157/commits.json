(fortunately for Atlas, affected principal axis aligns with the link axis),\n    Principal Moments of Inertia (MOI) are distributed equally between connected links.  This change should\n    have no effect on the dynamics of the overall system (and should probably be performed autonomously\n    by LCP solvers in general).\n  * In unconstrained directions, limit the mass ratio across connected links to a manually defined ratio.,\n    This change does affect CG location and overall inertia of links, but we check to see that\n    the overall CG change is not significant.\n  * In unconstrained directions, change the MOI so ratio across the joint is limited.\n    This is not done in any consistent manner in this commit.  For example, the talus IXX is directly\n    set as 0.5 * IXX of foot.\n\n=== Links Affected ===\n * There are 3 link chains being updated. In each of these chains, the intermediate link(s) have much smaller inertia than the end links:\n   a) utorso <back_ubx> mtorso <back_mby> ltorso <back_lbz> pelvis\n      * mass is distributed 5:1 across utorso and mtorso links.  Anticipating utorso link might grow\n        significantly with the addition of Atlas power pack.\n      * IYY is bewteen utorso and mtorso is distributed equally.\n      * IXX of mtorso is set to 0.5 of mtorso IXX.\n      * mass is distributed 10:1 across pelvis:ltorso.  Overall CG change is checked to make sure it\u2019s\n        not significant (change of 0.409, 0, -0.861mm).\n      * IZZ of utorso, mtorso and ltorso distributed equally.\n        Overall IZZ of utorso, mtorso, ltorso at lbz is checked to make sure there are no changes.\n      * IYY, IXX of pelvis and ltorso are distributed equally, being constrained, should not affect dynamics.\n   b) pelvis <*_leg_uhz> *_uglut <*_leg_mhx> *_lglut <*_leg_lhy> *_uleg\n      * This adjustment is done after the adjustments in a) are performed.\n      * mass is distributed 10:1 between pelvis:uglut, uleg:lglut.  Checking CG shift (-0.405, 0.227, -1.561mm).\n      * IZZ distributed equally between uglut, lglut and uleg, and check combined IZZ about uleg/lbz for sanity.\n      * IYY distributed equally between pelvis, uglut, lglut, and check combined IYY about pelvis link for sanity.\n      * IXX distributed euqally between uglut and pelvis.
