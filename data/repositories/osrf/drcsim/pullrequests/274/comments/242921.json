As a result, entering and exiting the mud pit is more complicated than the rest of the entire task combined.\n\nMy understanding is that with the PNG height map, you only get 256 levels in total. But 90% of those levels are spent creating the mountains in the distance and only 10% are spent on variations of the terrain that the robot will walk on.\n\nCan I suggest removing/lowering the mountains? With the 256 levels spaced between 0 and 2.5m you will get 1cm resolution making it possible to have gentle, gradual sloping out of the mud pit without discontinuities.\n\nI'm happy to help with heightmap image processing if thats possible", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Ian,\nI think teams will have issues with the heightmap descritrization - particularly the gradient entering and exiting the mud pit - which are about 45 degrees.
