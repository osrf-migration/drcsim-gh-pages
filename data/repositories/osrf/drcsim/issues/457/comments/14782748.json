I think that the z height may be modified before it is passed to the bdi controller or else the bdi simulated controller is different than the robot bdi controller.  If the first step has a z value of 0.15 and the second step has a z value of 0 the expected behavior is that the first step will go up 0.15m relative to the start and the second step will be at 0m relative to the first step (0.15m).
