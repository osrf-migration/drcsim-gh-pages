Moving the block out of the way of the right foot does allow the robot to stay up.\n* 2.  The collision model is larger than the visual model for the front of the foot - visually there is no collision, but the rectangular collision box does impact the block, the collision model should better match the foot\n* 3.  The inputs to AtlasBehaviorStepData.msg don't behave the same as on the real robot - a value of 0.15 lifts the foot 15cm above the previous foot (this matches), but the value of zero for the second (right foot) should lift the right foot up to the same height as the left foot.  This does not match.  This is assuming you are simulating the relative step mode.  Going up steps with both feet on every step would look like: 0.15, 0, 0.15, 0, 0.15, 0 (for the z values)\n* 4.  It is possible by carefully moving the cinder block and changing the second step to have a z of 0.15 to get both feet up, but it requires much more precision than on the real robot.  In particular, the toe must be further back from the cinder block and the heel must be further on the cinder block than with the real robot.\n* 5.  If even a small part of the heel is not on the block the foot goes unstable and falls off.
