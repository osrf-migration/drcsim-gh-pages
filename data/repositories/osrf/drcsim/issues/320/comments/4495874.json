See attached plots. They look very similar. As a check, we tested the standard PID controller in 1.8.5 and got the same results you had, so the difference is the controller.\n\nI have a hunch that the standard PID controller may be keeping the robot in place only by virtue of the foot contacts. Since our force controller is trying to not exert any forces on the ground with the feet in the runs for which I posted data, we don't get those foot forces keeping the robot in place. \n\nSee the attached screenshot for the contact forces seen when running the standard PID controller. There are contact forces on the thighs that would push the robot forward, but they are countered by the forces that the feet exert on the bottom plate of the chassis.\n\nAny idea what causes those forward-pointing force vectors on the thighs by the way?\n\nThanks,\nTwan\n\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>John,</p>\n<p>We tested our controller with 1.8.3 and 1.8.5 (again).
