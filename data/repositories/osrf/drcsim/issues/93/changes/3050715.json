When the terrain is just flat and only some objects in the distance the camera should be able to see them and not just cut off causing the robot to only see sky, so for those cases a farther far clipping plane would work better (otherwise you end up with just sky and no features).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nThomas", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi John,</p>\n<p>regarding the far clipping plane it depends on what the worlds are going to look like.
