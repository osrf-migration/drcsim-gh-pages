As the coupling is screwed in, this misalignment may cause a jam and prevent further turning. Effectively, the misaligned coupling sweeps out a cone as it rotates, and this cone needs to fit into the spout hole.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bug if:\r\n\r\na) the currently required alignment tolerance eliminates the problem (can't tell).\r\n\r\nb) AddJoint somehow perfectly aligns the coordinate frames of the hose and the coupling and then makes the joint.\r\n\r\nI would request b) to be implemented if it is not already.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nChris", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Since we are winding down to the last bug fixes, I thought I might mention something that may or may not be a bug.
