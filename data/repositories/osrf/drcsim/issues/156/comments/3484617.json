Looking at the file atlas_sandia_hands.urdf I noticed that the collisions and visuals for the palm and fingers were commented, for example:\n\n```\n<!-- begin collision mesh of f2 ->\n      <collision group=\"default\">\n        <origin xyz=\"0 0 0\" rpy=\"0 0 0\"/>\n        <geometry>\n          <mesh filename=\"package://sandia_hand_description/meshes/palm.stl\"/>\n        </geometry>\n      </collision>\n      <!-   end collision mesh of f2 -->\n\n\n```\n(I think because they are now defined inside the plugin libSandiaHandPlugin.so). \n\nOnce I uncommented them (and adding the proper path to the meshes in my computer), the problem was solved. There was no more passing through the fingers. \n\nI noticed that when adding the robot model to rviz, there were some warnings with respect to the fingers and palm collisions:\n\n```\n[ WARN] [1363907234.753504420, 43.822000000]: 'default' collision group has 2 collisions for Link 'right_palm', taking the first one as default\n[ WARN] [1363907234.753811392, 43.822000000]: 'default' collision group has 2 collisions for Link 'right_f0_0', taking the first one as default\n[ WARN] [1363907234.753972105, 43.822000000]: 'default' collision group has 2 collisions for Link 'right_f0_1', taking the first one as default\n[ WARN] [1363907234.754284221, 43.822000000]: 'default' collision group has 2 collisions for Link 'right_f0_2', taking the first one as default\n```\nThis means that I was double loading the collision polygons (the ones uncommented and the ones inside the plugin) and that the first ones were taken as default. Which then, means that the meshes inside the plugin are buggy. \n\nSo I am now able to do test without this problem, but if the plugin is intended to be use for the VRC this should be solved.
