Our control software imports SDF files directly to parse the robot parameters. Our own simulation software is able to read SDF world files to simulate the environment. With these changes there is no easy way to import the robot model in our controller or simulation any more. The recent changes require us to spend significant time to figure how and where all the models are stored, hence the request for an extensive changelog. As DRCsim is the source for the atlas data and the worlds, itheyshould be available in an easily accasible format/location. The world files are probably also going to be used by track A teams without Atlas.\n\nAlthough the Gazebo physics blow up on us now, we like to test our controller on Gazebo as well, mostly for multi-contact behaviour, hence the custom plugin. Because this plugin sets joint forces and torques directly as well as controlling the sim world it probably interferes with the  VRCPlugin. Hence our desire to have a clean world file with just the plugins we want (for 3.0 we use a xslt file to add our custom plugin).\n\nWe were hoping that, like Gazebo, DRCsim would have an optional dependency on ROS. We write our software in Java, which does not have a high performance ROS binding. Furthermore, we like to run our controller and sim on multiple platforms, making the use of ROS hard. Therefore, we try to avoid any dependency on ROS.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>As I understand from this, there is no easy way any more to generate a SDF file based on the .world files.
