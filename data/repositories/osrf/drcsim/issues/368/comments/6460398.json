It is a direct matching between your ubuntu distro and the ROS distro. I'm afraid that drcsim team won't be able to support all kind of combinations of ubuntu - ROS, so this is difficult to change.\n\n* It will be a hydro release for drcsim  in raring, I hope (drcsim-3.1) sometime as soon as possible.
