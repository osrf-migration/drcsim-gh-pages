Try turning the handle clock-wise as soon as the coupling is snapped in place, or changing gravity to (0, 0.1, 0).\n\nJohn", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Maurice,</p>\n<p>I was able to detach and reattach several times with my test script.\nNote the screw joint will detach if it detects counter rotation of 0.3 radian or 0.3mm of linear displacement away from the standpipe.
