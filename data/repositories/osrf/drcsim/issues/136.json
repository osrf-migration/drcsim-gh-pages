I know people have requested this behavior, but I think it's a bad default behavior for several reasons.  First, it requires the use of the gui, or at least a gazebo client, to unpause gazebo, which seems to be a weird thing to require from VRC teams using this for the DRC competition.  Second, while it is easy to add a '-u' argument in a launch file when the run-gazebo scipt is called, there is no equivalent for overriding the default '-u' in a launch file.  As of now, we are having to edit ALL of our launch files to call a local version of run-gazebo that doesn't start paused.  The alternative would be to write a plugin that unpauses when a ROS message is received, or to write a Gazebo client that simply unpauses then ends.  None of these are ideal, when the behavior could be to start unpaused, unless a '-u' flag is given in a launch file to pause.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>10 days ago (Commit <a href=\"#!/osrf/drcsim/commits/3fd1279\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ap-connect-link\">3fd1279</a>), Nate commited a change to run_gazebo in atlas_utils that forces Gazebo, when using the traditional launch files, to start the sim paused.
