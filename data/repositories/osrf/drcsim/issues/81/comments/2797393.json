Using the visual geometry for lasers' ray-tracing would allow you to use whatever simplified geometry you want without worrying about influence on the robot's perception system.\n\nSpeaking of lidar, the current gazebo lidar is still only running at ~34Hz instead of the full 40Hz.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>As outlined in my gazebo ticket linked above using the visual geometry for laser scanning is pretty much required as the robot would be able to \"see through\" objects otherwise and hence cheat.
