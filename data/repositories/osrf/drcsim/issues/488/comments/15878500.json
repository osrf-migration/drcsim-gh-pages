So I need to somehow compensate out the additive\n\"damping\" you added in the physics on in my feedforward torques. Right now,\nI am assuming a simple viscous damping model, which I believe is what you\nguys are trying to get in the infinite computational budget case. And for\nthis simple model, I need to know the effective damping coefficient. I am\nopen to more complex damping model, but at the end of the day, I need some\nmodel with some numbers from you guys that accurately reflect what's going\non in the simulator.\n\nI also think it's desirable for me to turn off damping completely, which is\nnot an option in the current setup, since it always get min to the default.\nI might be wrong on this.\nI did try hack AtlasPlugin so that there is not damping, by getting rid of\nthe additive force, and SetDamping(0,0), the simulator didn't blow up. And\nI got what I wanted as well in that case.\n\nthanks", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>ok, here is what I wanted, and let's figure out how to get there.</p>\n<p>In my model, I am assuming a perfect second order model, and I am doing\npure torque control.
