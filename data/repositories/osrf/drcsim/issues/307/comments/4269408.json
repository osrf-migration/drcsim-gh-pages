In the example code, the Work Thread publishes commands at a rate of about 500Hz, if that is how fast it runs, why wouldn't I want the simulator to wait for every command? \n\nOur controller right now runs using ros::Rate() which uses simulation time to time it. We attempt to run at a 500hz simulation time rate. Are you saying that it is better to be using wall time instead of simulation time to run our controllers? \n\n\nEdit: Is this also a way of saying we need to be running our controllers at 200Hz instead?
