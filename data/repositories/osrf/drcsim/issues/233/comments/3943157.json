Not having a polaris ranger handy, I did a search online and found a message board [1] where people posted a turn diameter of around 13 and 14 feet for the 800 and 850 models.  In the simulation it has a turn diameter of 23.7 feet.  Same results when doing the turn at max velocity and 1/2 velocity.\n\nIn older version there was also a problem where sometimes you would spin 90 degrees when applying the breaks.  I'll see if the latest code has that still.\n\n[1] http://www.polarisatvforums.com/forums/atv-purchasing-price/1381-turning-radius-info-wanted.html", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Still need to do more testing, but I can see two issues from the limited testing that I have done already.</p>\n<p>1)  If you look at the trajectories above you can see one is very different from the others.  it shouldn't diverge like that in such a controlled environment.<br />\n2) The turn radius still way to large.
